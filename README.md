/**
 * Unverified opinions from the internet:
 *
 * Mobx is extremely fast when used correctly, and very good if you need to highly optimize rendering in React.
 *
 * In Mobx you usually get the best performance by mutating existing state and keeping stable object references where values are evaluated as late as possible. It's literally the opposite of the immutable approach.
 *
 * Mobx stores do not need to be pure, it works really well to put event handlers in the store for instance.
